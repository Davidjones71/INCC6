<h3><a name="D2HTopic_26" id="D2HTopic_26"></a><a name="_Toc224737333" id="_Toc224737333">QC and Test 
Parameters</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To use this feature, select<i> Maintain | QC and Test 
Parameters. </i>The program performs several quality control tests on the 
measurement data. One of these is a checksum test that is always applied to 
multiplicity data to check for internal consistency. There are no test 
parameters for this test, because exact agreement is required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you start a measurement of any type under 
<i>Acquire</i>, you can select whether or not to use the optional quality 
control tests. If you use the quality control (QC tests), the program will 
perform the accidentals/singles test and outlier test.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Measurements normally consist of repeat cycles, for example, 
10 cycles of 100 seconds each. The accidentals/singles test compares the singles 
rate with the accidental coincidence rate at the end of each cycle. If the 
neutron source rate is constant during the cycle, then, within statistical 
errors, the accidentals rate should equal the square of the singles rate times 
the gate length. If the rates do not agree within statistical errors and the 
quality control tests are turned on, then the cycle is rejected and another is 
made automatically. The limit of acceptance is set by the parameter 
"Accidentals/singles test outlier limit (sigma)", which is the limit expressed 
in standard deviations. The usual limit is 4 standard deviations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two additional limits used by the 
accidentals/singles test. The first of these is the "Accidentals/singles test 
rate limit (1/seconds)", which is usually set to 1000 1/second. The 
accidentals/singles test is not done if the singles rate is below this limit. 
The reason for this limit is that, at low count rates, room background 
variations can make the test fail, even though the system is working normally. 
For the same reason, the test is never done for passive background 
measurements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The other additional limit is the "Accidentals/singles test 
precision limit (%)", which is usually set to 0.1%. If the accidentals and 
singles rates agree within this limit, the accidentals/singles statistical test 
is not done and the cycle is accepted. The reason for this limit is that the 
test can fail for cycles with excellent precision even though the 
accidentals/singles agreement is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The outlier test compares the results of individual cycles 
with the average of all the cycles and rejects cycles that fall outside the test 
limit. Additional cycles are then made automatically, if needed, to replace any 
rejected cycles. The parameter is "Outlier test limit (sigma)", which is the 
test limit expressed in standard deviations. The usual limit is 3 standard 
deviations. For verification measurements, the outlier test is done on the assay 
mass calculated for each of the cycles. For most other measurements, the outlier 
test is done on the doubles and triples rates. The outlier test is not done for 
precision measurements, because the purpose of the precision test is to compare 
the observed and theoretical standard deviations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The measurement control chi-squared limit, expressed in 
percent, determines the upper and lower bounds for the chi-squared 
test; the limit is the probability that the measured chi-squared value will 
be between the upper and lower limits in the ideal case where the system is 
perfectly stable and the theoretical standard deviation is known exactly. The 
default value for the chi-squared limit is 99%.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To prevent a series of bad measurements from continuing 
indefinitely, there is a test parameter called "Max # of checksum or 
accidentals/singles failures", which is normally set to 10. If the number of 
cycles that fail these tests exceeds the limit, the measurement is stopped and 
the results are calculated, if possible, from any good cycles in the data set. 
To effectively disable this test, set this value to a large number, for example 
1000.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If two or more passive analysis methods have been selected, 
then an automatic comparison of the verification results is made. The accepted 
verification result will be the “normal” analysis method unless it differs from 
the “backup” method by more than n standard deviations, where n is the 
“Normal/backup verification test limit (sigma)”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A comparison of the requested and actual high voltage is 
made after each cycle to insure that the high voltage has not drifted. If the 
“High voltage test limit (%)” is exceeded, that cycle is marked as having failed 
the HV test. The default value is 1 percent. To disable the test, set this value 
to 1000. It may occasionally be of interest to know what the high voltage is for 
each cycle. This can be done by setting this parameter to zero which will cause 
the high voltage to be displayed for every cycle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A checkbox is provided for disabling consistency tests 
between shift register and multiplicity data if a multiplicity shift register is 
being used. These tests should only be turned off (box not checked) for very 
high counting rates where the multiplicity counter will overflow. The singles 
rate at which overflow will occur is dependent on gate length, and is 
approximately 1.5 million singles per second for a gate length of 64 
microseconds. A smaller gate length will allow counting at higher rates before 
overflow occurs. The checksum test is never performed, regardless of whether 
this box is checked, if an AMSR is being used because fast accidentals will 
cause the test to fail most of the time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Two radio buttons are provided for choosing how to calculate 
the doubles rate. If you choose “Measure accidentals count rates” from the shift 
register then the following equation is used:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormalIndent" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt">Doubles rate = ((Reals + 
Accidentals) - Accidentals) / count time</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you choose “Calculate the accidentals count rates (T<span style="COLOR: black">^</span><sup>2</sup>G)” then the following equation is 
used:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormalIndent" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt">Doubles rate = ((Reals + 
Accidentals) - (singles * singles * gate length)) / count time</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you choose to calculate the accidentals rates then the 
error analysis will automatically be set to the sample standard deviation 
method. The default is to use the measured accidentals rates. When the doubles 
rate is obtained from the calculated accidentals coincidence rate, the doubles 
rate for a complete measurement is calculated as the average of the doubles 
rates for the individual cycles and differs slightly from the doubles rate 
calculated from the summed raw data; this method was chosen because the 
calculation assumes that the singles rate is constant during the data 
collection, and this is more likely to be true for each cycle than for the 
entire measurement.</p></div></body></html>
